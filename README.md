I am a dedicated and passionate individual with a profound interest in programming, consistently seeking opportunities to tackle challenges and enhance my skills. My journey in the field of technology began with a rigorous selection process that led me to enroll in the technical course at UNIVILLE, generously sponsored by FAPESC.

Currently, I am channeling my enthusiasm and commitment into my academic pursuits at UNISOCIESC, where I am actively engaged in pursuing a degree in Analysis and Systems Development. My academic journey reflects my unwavering commitment to excellence and a desire to contribute meaningfully to the dynamic world of software development.

Feel free to explore my repositories to witness my evolving journey in the realm of programming and technology.
